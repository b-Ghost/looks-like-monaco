# looks-like-monaco
Created during the AnglHack hackathon I participated in on the 29th of April, 2017. Notably, the first time I seriously tried to learn using Github. Here's looking forward to a very active contribution!

Going to learn the following this Hack-a-thon:
  > Advanced C++ (Basically Ranade's book)
  > CSS
  > Javascript
  > HTML
  > Hopefully, Python too
